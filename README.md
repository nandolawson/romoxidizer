This software is used to trim ROMs for Nintendo Game Boy Advance and in the future Nintendo DS. It is written entirely in Rust and works on Windows, Linux & macOS, regardless of whether the CPU architecture is x86 or ARM. As far as I know, this is the only open-source software of its kind.

> âš  romoxidizer is currently in early development. Even though the software has been tested, only ROMs for which a backup exists should be processed.

## Usage

Pretty simple. Here is an example under Windows:

```powershell
romoxidizer.exe C:\path\to\rom
```

Done! The ROM is trimmed.

## Compiling

No extra steps necessary. Just run cargo build.
